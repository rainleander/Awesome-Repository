## Welcome to Rain's Awesome New Repository

Hello!

I am a process oriented, superbly creative, interdisciplinary community liaison with a Bachelor’s in dance and a Master’s in information technology. An epic public speaker, I have disappeared within a box stuffed with swords, created life, and gone skydiving with the Queen.

Yes, really.

I am an active technical contributor with Tinkerbell [0], RDO [1], Fedora Project [2], OpenStack [3], TripleO [4], and DjangoGirls [5] as well as a maintainer of several smaller open source projects like Equinix Metal's Uniform Standards [6] and Non Binary Resources Awesome List [7].

I joyously seek the next remote developer relations adventure in the open source space as this is the community where I have been a part of - collaborating and inspiring, developing and documenting, encouraging and protecting - for over twelve years.

I am particularly keen to work with YOU because we share a passion for open source, love of community, and drive to change the world. I look forward to discussing how I can help you succeed and, if you're interested, sure, chatting about swords and skydiving, at your nearest convenience via https://calendly.com/rainleander.

All the best,
Rain
